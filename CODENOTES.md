* I don't fully get the Gaussian pulse stuff in section 4.2 of the supplementary material of Schwartz et al. However, maybe this page will explain to a degree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_polarization

* I'm not really sure yet how to model the free evolution and decay of the Hamiltonian with the Linblad equation.
